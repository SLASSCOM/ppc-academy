## Why
Data and customers are vital assets to a company. Data collected from customers must be handled carefully with transparency and adhering to privacy policies, which build trust and accountability with your customers.

## How
The following guidelines help to protect private information:

- Integrate training on data privacy into the general training program to prevent social engineering attacks.
- Implement a zero-trust model by restricting access to the entire network and whitelisting only the essential entities.
- Production, development, and testing environments must be segregated, and tight security must be enforced on the production environment.
- Follow the guidelines of regulations like GDPR, CCPA. I.e., Signing contracts with data processors, Encrypt data at rest and transit, regular audits, etc.
- Implement the IDS (Intrusion Detection System) and IPS (Intrusion Prevention System).
