## Why
A strong positive brand helps you to get things done more effectively because it establishes specialization and enhances delivery value. Team branding can also provide an invaluable path to productivity. It creates renewed inspiration and engagement within the team to become a high-performing product engineering team. Effective team branding results in recognition from customers and peers. With recognition comes feedback and insight, which assists in making your team even more streamlined and efficient.

## How
To create a team brand, the team needs to have a clear understanding of its domain expertise, its core technical competencies, the value it delivers, and its brand personality (what is distinctive about the way the team does things?). Crafting a brand for a team is strikingly similar to creating one for a business or even a personal brand. The following are some tips to build team branding:
- Maintain a team blog and share the teamâ€™s experience in product engineering.
- Publish utility tools, pet projects into Github.
- Represent the team in meetups and tech events.
- Build more expertise within the team (uniqueness of the team).
- Provide consultations to other teams within the company.
- Embrace continuous improvement in team practices.
- Inspire each team member to build their own personal brand in product engineering
