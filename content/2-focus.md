During the explore stage, you usually come up with a vast amount of ideas and value propositions the product may offer. The success of a product has no direct connection to the number of features it offers. Therefore, a smaller set of cohesive, tuned (targeted) features is usually more effective than a large set of features.

Focus is where you narrow down your attention to the details of the most important aspects such as market segment, value proposition, brand story and the overall solution architecture.
