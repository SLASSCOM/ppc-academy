# SLASSCOM Product and Platform Council (PPC)

An initiative by [SLASSCOM](http://slasscom.lk), the Product and Platform Council operate with the vision to build capability that would enable Sri Lankan enterprises to create high technology products and platforms that would attract global demand.

This learning portal is a part of PPC Training and Academy to provide the essential knowledge required to build such products and platforms.

## Software Product and Platform Market

Every year, many ISVs (Independent Software Vendors) and Startups invest on digital services and products to develop and sustain their business. According to researchandmarkets.com the market size for SaaS (Software as a Service) alone, worthed $134.44 billion in 2018. This market growth is at a CAGR of 13.1% and believed to reach a staggering $220.21 billion by 2022.

## Despite Growth, Most Products Fail

The market trend is lucrative. Despite that trend, many Software Products fail. Why? Well, they fail to reach the full potential due to vital issues in product management and engineering.

Let’s face the facts. Creating a market winning (leading) product is not easy. If that’s your goal, you need a massive amount of additional knowledge and skills beyond typical software development. You’re going to need a broader sense of the domain, market trends, product management techniques, customer engagement ability as well as resilient engineering capabilities. These skills are not taught at universities or gained through general software development work. “Winning Product” equips you with these tools to help you attain that market leading edge.

## Products require additional skills

Common mistake of novice product teams is that they overlook the specialty of 'product' development. Product development is vastly different from bespoke/enterprise application development. Following sections outline some of the reasons behind the differences.

## Areas of excellence

In our experience, broadly, there are four areas your team must excel in developing a market winning product. You will find the importance and the descriptions of these 4 'areas of excellence' below.

### Market Sense

Market sense is arguably the most crucial factor for product success. The success of a product is in the hands of its users, customers, and the market. If your market does not see the value of your product, how good your UX or Technology, it will not see much success.

A product team must focus on the market factors such as below throughout the product journey.

- Competition
- Market trends (opportunities, risks)
- User behavior
- Business model
- etc.

### User Experience

Personal connection and a sense of meaning are essential for your users to build stickiness towards your product. If your competitors do a better job than you in this, your product will find it hard to attract and retain customers. You should pay constant attention to factors such as:

- Personas and their User Journeys
- Prototyping and Build-Measure-Learn loop
- Requirement Process
- Data-Driven Decisions through User behavior
- etc.

### Technology Mastery

Of course, it is your technology platform that enables you to deliver customer value. Products are expected to have the resilience to frequently evolving/changing demands. Agility is a core attribute alongside with the following factors:

- Underlying Platform
- Data Storage and Exchange
- Optimum Development Environment
- DevOps and Release Management
- Product Quality
- Security and Compliance
- etc.

### Customer Success

Your product is often an integral part of your user's/customer's journey of achieving a goal. Winning products usually have the best customer service scores. This is because the more the success your customer makes through your product, the more they buy from you.

- Nurture during prospect stage
- Ensure a world-class onboarding experience
- Support during the use of the product
- Assist in learning more about your product
- Ensure happy migration to your new product
- etc.

## Product and Platform Mindset

### Continuous Validation

Software products just like any other product, exist in a marketplace. Market forces as you know are dynamic by nature. If you embrace this principle and adopt the product market-fit and technology, you can be sustainable in the marketplace while gaining a higher ROI.

### Research

Ability to explore any product subject matter to find what's suitable for the problem domain within a reasonable time frame.

### Ownership

You and your team must have the total ownership of the product to ensure you provide your full commitment to make it successful. Many startups fail due to issues within the team. One main issue being the team not taking ownership for delivery excellence. Increase the ownership of the product by aligning career progression with the purpose of the product roadmap. Be responsible enough to take care of different aspects of the product and measure it against the outcome.

### Innovation Accounting

A Product needs to dynamically respond to markets and create value early on. A good example is how a startup works by minimizing the cost and trying to fit to the market needs. For software products, traditional matrices are not suitable. You need to measure the value creation that was brought on by software products considering the product lifecycle it goes through. Eg: during the early phase of the product life cycle there may not be enough customers to justify typical metrics. However, it’s possible to show customer engagement and the level of feedback your team has to align the product towards the market. This in turn, brings additional revenue. An innovation accounting mindset within the Winning Product model keeps the whole journey towards success in check. Your team must articulate and rally around key strategies of the product and leading indicators for success, from inception.

### Agility

Practice the philosophy of minimizing waste that’s deeply rooted in TPS (Toyota Production System). It promotes how best to respond to the market dynamics and operational dynamics while reducing waste.

## Product and Platform Lifecycle

[winningroduct.com](http://winningroduct.com) divides the product's lifecycle into 8 stages. These stages are unlike the Waterfall phases. They are iterative at product level, module level and even at feature level. These stages differ in subtle but important ways. By understanding the focus of each stage, you can understand the strategic activities within it.

### Explore

This is the initial stage where the founder conceives the idea to solve a problem he/she identified. It’s important at this stage to take a holistic view of the problem domain and broadly explore. This is where you explore different possibilities before locking down on a focused product concept.

You should study and analyze different paths and possibilities the new solution may take. Activities include brainstorming for idea generation as well as studying competitive offerings, and research publications from the marketplace. This phase is somewhat similar to Divergence and Discover phases of the Design Thinking process.

### Focus

During the explore stage, your team can usually come up with a vast amount of ideas and value propositions the product may offer. Success of a product has no direct relevance to the numerous features it offers. A smaller set of cohesive, targeted features are usually more effective than a large set of features.

Focus is the cycle to narrow down the attention to the most important aspects such as market segment, value proposition, brand story and the overall solution architecture.

### Immerse

Once the focus (niche) is defined, it’s time to delve into to the details required for solving the problem. During the immerse stage, you can consider solution's features, associated costs, timelines, etc. A lot of 'what if' analysis takes place and the base artifacts that are required for detailed planning are generated here.

### Plan

Once you analyze the impact of different variations during the immerse stage, you can create the initial plans for the rest of the project. Most of these plans are live documents that are kept updated right throughout the cycle.

Next you plan ahead the product development, implementation, operations without losing the ability to respond to market dynamics. It’s important to understand, this is NOT about making a 'Big Plan Upfront', but about making the base planning documents that can help with continuous planning throughout the lifecycle.

### Build

This is where you have the highest flexibility to change the solution implementation at a lower cost. Once the product passes this stage, changes become costly due to the involvement of other stakeholders such as customers. Make use of this stage to validate all the assumptions (technical, requirements, business) made during the previous stages.

Every requirement should be treated as an assumption with a plan to validate. Such validation can come in the form of MVPs, demos, user testing, architecture POCs, etc. During the build stage, consider onboarding pilot customers as testers to validate the primary value propositions.

### Optimize

Once you reach this stage, all your major assumptions should be validated. Product UVP must be clear and willingness of the customers to pay for that value proposition needs be confirmed. This means most of the core features are available and tested by your early customers during the 'Build' stage.

During optimize, you tune the product further to achieve maximum performance. You also carry out testing required for it to be adapted by a bigger scale of customers. This means the product quality, stability, visual appearance, onboarding procedures, etc. should be made world-class during this stage.

### Harvest

This is where your product returns back the investment. The focus of this stage is to retain happy and loyal customers, up sell more and get referrals to grow the business. You need very stable operational processes to respond to the customer issues and inquiries. Build and tune your sales and marketing processes to capture a greater market share.

### Retire

Regardless of how well the product is built and maintained, there is always a retirement time for products. Retirement can be called upon by a major technology or user behavior change in the marketplace. At this point you re-invent the technology platform / business model / user experience to keep an edge in the market. You should be watchful to identify this need so that they are able to disrupt their own business model before a competitor does.

When a next gen product is planned, it’s important to do it with minimal disturbance to the existing customers. You need to have clear and pain-free migration paths available and provide incentives/motivation for them to move-on. Long-term side-by-side operation of 2 major versions can be an extremely costly operation. For this reason, you must plan to complete migrating all your customers within a planned time span.
